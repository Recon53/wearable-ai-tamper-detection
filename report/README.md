# Project Report

This repository accompanies a final course project on detecting data
tampering in wearable devices using machine learning techniques.

## Report Overview
The project report covers:
- Background on wearable device security threats
- Motivation for AI-based tamper detection
- System architecture and detection pipeline
- Experimental methodology and evaluation
- Results, analysis, and conclusions

## Relationship to Code
The source code in this repository implements the detection pipeline
described in the report, including feature extraction and anomaly
detection logic.

## Notes
The full written report was submitted as part of academic coursework.
This repository serves as the implementation companion to that work.
