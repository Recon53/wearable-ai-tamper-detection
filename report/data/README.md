# Dataset Information

This project operates on wearable sensor data used to detect potential
tampering or anomalous behavior patterns.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is either:
- Simulated sensor data generated for experimental purposes, or
- Sanitized sample data representative of real wearable device signals.

No sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) is included
in this repository.

## Expected Format
Input data is expected to be in tabular format (e.g., CSV) containing
time-series sensor measurements such as accelerometer or physiological
signals.

## Usage
Users may adapt the `main.py` script to load their own wearable sensor
datasets following the expected format.
